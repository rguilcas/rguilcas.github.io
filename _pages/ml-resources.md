Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Geosciences** resource hub. This page hosts materials and links for deep learning, satellite imagery processing, and climate modeling.

## Frameworks & Tools

- **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)**: Popular deep learning framework used throughout the community.
- **[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: Foundation for classical machine learning (regression, clustering).
- **[Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org/)**: Tool for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) of big data.

## Community & Learning

- **[Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/)**: A global community of researchers and practitioners.
- **[ML for Climate Science (Course Materials)](https://github.com/m-albert/ml-for-geoscience-course)**: Curated repository for finding specialized models.
