Upwelling delivers key nutritional and energetic subsidies to coral reef communities that affect the growth,
abundance, and ecology of organisms across trophic levels. However, the cross-scale oceanographic and atmo-
spheric drivers of localized upwelling on many reefs remain unresolved, limiting our ability to predict how cli-
mate change might disrupt upwelling patterns and impact reef communities across geographies. Using high
temporal resolution (10 second) in situ temperature measurements collected over 18 months that encompassed
the strongest positive Indian Ocean Dipole phase of this century, we demonstrate a highly nonlinear effect of
climate-driven mixed layer depth on upwelling intensity across the latitudinal range of the Chagos Archipelago
($\sim$ 200 km). The exposure of shallow (10–25 m depth) reef communities to deeper upwelled waters was maxi-
mized when the mixed layer depth was shallower than $\sim$ 40 m, but virtually absent when the mixed layer depth
was deeper than $\sim$ 60 m. By combining these temperature data with nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15 N) from a com-
mon macroalga, we show these variations in upwelling correlate with altered nutrient sources that have direct
measurable impacts on reef organisms across the Archipelago. We further show that over the past 40 years, posi-
tive phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole correlate with an anomalously deep surface mixed layer on these reefs,
each time likely restricting upwelling. Given these extreme events are increasing in frequency under climate
change, this poses the possibility of a markedly different upwelling regime across the Archipelago over the com-
ing century, with currently unknown ecological consequences.
