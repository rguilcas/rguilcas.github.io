The spatial pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) affects the global radiative budget through
the “pattern effect.” While previous studies highlighted the role of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in
unforced pattern effect, a systematic assessment of the dominant modes of SST variability for the top of
atmosphere energy budget has been lacking. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we identify Eastern Pacific
and Modoki ENSO as the two leading modes most relevant to the pattern effect at interannual timescales. These
ENSO variants exhibit distinct radiative signatures due to subtle shifts in the location of SST anomalies relative
to the climatological warm pool. Furthermore, analysis of individual ENSO events indicates that each event has
a unique radiative signature depending on its evolving spatial structure. These findings highlight the importance
of accounting for ENSO diversity to accurately understand how modes of SST variability influence the global
energy budget.
